# Forensics project

Goal of the project : making a command-line tool to detect edited images

A few ideas :
* Focusing on jpeg images only might be a good idea (most of the pictures are jpeg anyway). We might focus on one software as well (Adobe Photoshop ?).
* Check the exif data from jpeg images.
* Try to detect one or two specific attacks such as copy/paste attack.

#### Deadline : 25/06/2018
